                  <p>
                    As a Full Stack Developer, I have created and deployed a wide range of responsive and dynamic web projects. My frontend projects include creative HTML/CSS designs, interactive Bootstrap websites, and advanced React applications with component-based architecture and state management using Redux. I have developed e-commerce interfaces, admin dashboards, and product listing pages. On the backend, Iâ€™ve worked with Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to build secure and scalable APIs, user authentication systems, and database-driven applications. Each project reflects my ability to transform ideas into fully functional digital solutions with clean UI, performance optimization, and strong backend logic.
